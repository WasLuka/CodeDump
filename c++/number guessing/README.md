This is a program that guesses a number that you come up with.
The numbers that can guess are 1<=X>=100.

Commands:
yes -It chose the right number,
h -It chose too high number,
l - It choose too low number,

when you type yes it will say how many guesses it needed.

How it works:

it always chooses the middle of the known limits, so at the start it always chooses 50 as it is the middle of 100 and 0.
This gets repeated every time until it guesses the number.
